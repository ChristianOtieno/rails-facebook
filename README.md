## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```$ bundle install```

Next, migrate the database:

```$ rails db:migrate```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```$ rails test```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```$ rails server```
